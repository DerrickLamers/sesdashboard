* If none created yet, create a new Configuration Set. Go to `Configuration sets` menu item under `Configuration` section 
  and click `Create set`. Fill `Configuration set name` and create set. At Event configuration page 
  click `Event destinations` and `Add destination`. Chose `Event types` you wish to track and click `Next`.
  Under `Destination options` choose `Amazon SNS`, fill destination `Name`. Next create new `SNS topic` or use existing.

### AWS SES Console v1:
* Go to Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) console.
  There are 2 ways to configure events publishing. First is to create new Configuration Set.
  It allows you to track opens and clicks but requires you to pass specific email header `X-SES-CONFIGURATION-SET`. 
  More about headers configuration: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/event-publishing-send-email.html
  Second option doesn't require any changes in your existing app, but cannot track clicks and opens.
* **First option**: Select Configuration Sets menu. Click `Create Configuration Set` or edit your existing set. 
  Add new SNS Destination, select events to track and create SNS topic.
* **Second option**: Under `Identity Management` select Domain or Email address and open `Notifications` tab. 
  Click `Edit Configuration` and create or select SNS Topic for events you wish to track. Enable `Include original headers`.
  
### SNS Configuration step.
* Next, navigate to Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).
* In `Topics` section select topic you created before.
* Add new subscription with HTTP (or HTTPS protocol if configured) and paste WebHook url from `/project/1/edit` SesDashboard project page. 
  Check `Enable raw message delivery`.
